# What is _Lcalc_ ? #

Lcalc is an helpful multiplateform calculation program for AFOLs and modelists.


# What can you do with it ? #

For now, it can calculate the scale of a reduced model (in LEGO bricks or not) in relation with the real object, and convert some unites (studs lenght, plates height, centimeters, inches and LDraw Units.)


# How to use it ? #

You can use the command-line (since the 5<sup>th</sup> version) and the graphical interface. The command-line is recommanded for linux users (because it's faster) and the GUI for windows users. But both can be used for each.
